Graphical [Janet](https://janet-lang.org/) REPL

Still experimental. I'll try to make this a better REPL than the terminal one (`janet`).

[Demo Video](https://www.1a-insec.net/blog/20-janet-graphical-repl/)

To run the program, run `zig build run` with Zig 0.11.0.

## To do

- [x] unique `def` for each window/object (all starts with `_`)
- [x] closable windows (delete variable on close)
- [ ] "Do it" and "Get it"
- [ ] unclosable root window with demo window toggle
- [ ] "copy variable name" button
- [ ] show stdout/stderr in window somehow
- [ ] save state
